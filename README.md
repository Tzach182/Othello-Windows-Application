### Gameplay
Each player takes turns placing their colored pieces on the board, with the goal of having the majority of the pieces be their color at the end of the game.
If a player places a piece such that one or more of their opponent's pieces are surrounded by pieces of their own color, those opponent's pieces are flipped to become the player's color.
If a player is unable to make a move, their turn is skipped.
